    "As a data scientist, you will need to clean data, wrangle and munge it, visualize it, build predictive models, and interpret these models. Before you can do so, however, you will need to know how to get data into Python. In this course, you'll learn the many ways to import data into Python: from flat files such as .txt and .csv; from files native to other software such as Excel spreadsheets, Stata, SAS, and MATLAB files; and from relational databases such as SQLite and PostgreSQL.\n",

    "In this chapter, you'll learn how to import data into Python from all types of flat files, which are a simple and prevalent form of data storage. You've previously learned how to use NumPy and pandasâ€”you will learn how to use these packages to import flat files and customize your imports."
